It is\r\n         * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\r\n         * your questions.\r\n         *\r\n         * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\r\n         * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\r\n         *\r\n         * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\r\n         *\r\n         *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\r\n         *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\r\n         *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\r\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\r\n         *\r\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\r\n         *\r\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\r\n         *\r\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\r\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\r\n         *\r\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\r\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\r\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\r\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\r\n         *\r\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\r\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\r\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\r\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\r\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\r\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\r\n         *\r\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\r\n         *\r\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\r\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\r\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\r\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\r\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\r\n         *\r\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\r\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\r\n         *     pixels!\r\n         *\r\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\r\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\r\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\r\n         *\r\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\r\n         *\r\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\r\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\r\n         *\r\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\r\n         *\r\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\r\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\r\n         *     you know.\r\n         *\r\n         * Implementation info:\r\n         *\r\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\r\n         * average mouse:\r\n         *\r\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\r\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\r\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\r\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\r\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\r\n         *\r\n         * On the trackpad:\r\n         *\r\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\r\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\r\n         *\r\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\r\n         * also missing delta values.\r\n         *\r\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\r\n         *\r\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\r\n         *\r\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\r\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.

从第一个儿子出生，大家都围着团团转，当然我没太多去管他，基本上都是老人家带到大的，感觉我很愧疚于他，他现在跟同龄人相比，他还差好远，不会自己拉尿，不是很独立的吃饭，不怎么会说话，跳舞也不会，画画也不会......，然而老大已经是四岁了。与老二相比，老二的独立性可强了，他会自己吃饭，会学炒菜，会拿着拖把，会自己一个人睡觉，会说尿尿了，会拿着钥匙开门......不过老二才两岁，相差甚远，这也不能怪老人家，老人家帮我们带是一种好意。当然现在我已经把老大接手过来了，已经快半年了，慢慢的也改变了很多，以前老大跟班里的同学都是不合群的，而且攻击性很强，现在老大已经好很多了，会跟同学一起玩了，不会像以前那样在班级里面跑来跑去了。所以看到这些我都很欣慰。他在进步。因为这段时间都在陪伴老大，慢慢的把老二疏远了，所以老二也没怎么在进步了。

从第一个儿子出生，大家都围着团团转，当然我没太多去管他，基本上都是老人家带到大的，感觉我很愧疚于他，他现在跟同龄人相比，他还差好远，不会自己拉尿，不是很独立的吃饭，不怎么会说话，跳舞也不会，画画也不会......，然而老大已经是四岁了。与老二相比，老二的独立性可强了，他会自己吃饭，会学炒菜，会拿着拖把，会自己一个人睡觉，会说尿尿了，会拿着钥匙开门......不过老二才两岁，相差甚远，这也不能怪老人家，老人家帮我们带是一种好意。当然现在我已经把老大接手过来了，已经快半年了，慢慢的也改变了很多，以前老大跟班里的同学都是不合群的，而且攻击性很强，现在老大已经好很多了，会跟同学一起玩了，不会像以前那样在班级里面跑来跑去了。所以看到这些我都很欣慰。他在进步。因为这段时间都在陪伴老大，慢慢的把老二疏远了，所以老二也没怎么在进步了。
